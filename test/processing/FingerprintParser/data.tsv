zebraYYVH4N	zebra	25 - 34	No	2	1	2	2	5	1	At least once per year	I chose Option 1	I chose option 1. Because it makes good use of natural light.	4	4	4	4	
zebra47W2Q5	zebra	25 - 34	Yes	4	4	3	2	2	5	At least once per week	I chose Option 1	The design met all of the criteria: FAR below 5.0m and residential and institutional levels were above the requirements.  While it didn't have retail, it seemed the design seemed to be best fit for the site. The other metrics for hotel and parking seemed reasonable, but it would be nice to include the code requirements in the building.	4	4	4	3	The glossary terms were helpful and would be especially helpful for people without any background in real estate. The view settings were complete, and easy to use. The basemap loading tool was helpful for context. The model summary was well laid out. And the save buttons were easy to use. My questions:; - is this supposed to be a visualization tool over a design tool?; - would it be possible to create custom design tools to allow people to interact with the model?; - who would this software be for? designers, real estate, public, etc?; ; Suggestions:; - The font is very small, at least on my computer screen (1920x1080). I couldn't seem to change it as I would in a browser.; - It would be interesting to connect it to OSM and import meta data for existing buildings / context.; - annotations would be interesting to describe problem areas in a particular design. Then you could save that view with associated notes.; - I would like to play with the voxels, next version?; - It would be nice to set constraints and see if they are met in the design. The software could notify the user based on desired levels. ; - I would be interested to know where you plan to take this and next steps!
zebra4EU49R	zebra	35 - 44	Yes	3	1	3	1	1	1	Rarely or Never	I chose Option 3	Only options 1 and 3 met the requirements outlined in the instructions.  Option 2 had an FAR value that was too high.  Of those two options, I liked Option 3 the best. I had a preference to site the residential tower (I assumed residential was yellow) away from the main street with retail on the first two floors (I assumed retail was red).  This leaves the institutional tenant to use their space however they see fit and not be limited by having residential owners/tenants above their space.  I hope this selection serves the residents of Beaverton well!	4	4	5	4	Knowing the cardinal directions of the site may have influenced my decision. Knowing the color key for the different uses (Institutional, Residential, Retail, etc) may have influenced my decision - but it was fun to be able to guess what the designer was up to when assembling the different options.

panda85FWQH	panda	18 - 24	No	2	1	1	3	3	4	At least once per week	I chose my own completely original scenario	The most influenced factor is how to increase the site's floor area ratio under more close to the 5.0, but for my design is just only 3.7. I am not for sure this value is more bigger sound good or not.	3	4	4	5	It's my first time to design total new structure model by myself. Sound interesting.
zebraFPWYU9	zebra	45 - 54	Yes	2	2	1	4	5	3	At least once per week	I chose Option 3	Option 3 met the requirements for residential, institutional floor space and for the floor area ratio (FAR). It appears to be placed in the acceptable podium areas.  The two buildings seemed more aesthetically pleasing than the single building of option 1.	4	3	3	3	I was uncertain about whether the placement in each option met the requirements.  I had printed the guidelines and checked them manually.; I wasn't clear what additional criteria to use for the options.; Option 2 was slightly over the limit for Floor Area Ratio, how to treat this whether it's a hard limit or could there be room for negotiation?  ; I was able to pan and control the viewer.  The question about how confident will the community of Beaveton like the scenario, I felt only moderate level as the criteria defined are met and I would wonder if the community will be satisfied with the criteria as defined.; 
pandaS64XYV	panda	18 - 24	No	2	1	1	5	4	5	At least once per week	I chose my own completely original scenario	Actually, I have not noticed that there are some templates, but I have chosen my scenario with an empty one because I would like to design a circular building and  I do not like the existence of blank space.	2	2	3	3	I think it would be better if it is possible to build something in the air, such as bridges.
pandaM6DYCG	panda	35 - 44	No	1	1	1	4	4	3	At least once per year	I chose a modified version of Option 3	I made (poorly designed) improvements to zone daycare and entertainment districts for the faculty and students, respectively. Other than that, Option 3 seemed the most "sound" in design compared to the other two options. ; ; 	3	1	4	4	I could not figure out at first how to add the parcels because the color was too light. Hence, I spent a lot of time trying to figure the problem out. The first thing I did was to omit the exclusion areas completely, but figuring out that playing with the offsets was the key to actually see the parcels. (Honestly, I thought this was a trick on the experimenters part to see if I figured it out); ; Secondly, I paid almost no attention to the size of the individual cubes/parcels. Only at the very last minute I kind of made note of the height of each floor. ; ; Honestly, I made Option 2 worse, but regardless, there was a need to add amenities to the design anyway. Maybe if I put, let's say, three hours in to actually trying to design something that makes sense, the result would have been better. ; ; And I completely forgot about parking. ; ; The tool was pretty easy to use, although as I mentioned earlier the color scheme made it difficult to troubleshoot why I wasn't able to add any buildings. 
zebraMVDFN8	zebra	18 - 24	Yes	3	2	1	4	2	3	At least once per week	I chose Option 3	I first eliminated Option 2 because the FAR was over the bounds that were set.; I assumed Yellow = Residential, Pink = Institutional, Green = Hotel, Red = Retail, Gray = Parking; Although the structure of Option 1 seemed to be the most open and accessible by the main street, it seemed inconvenient to have residents and tourists enter through the institution to get to their living spaces since it was all stacked. This could also lead to crowding issues for students and staff who needed to access the institution. ; ; Option 3 seems to be able to provide several convenient institution entrances along the main streets as well as from the residential area. I felt that separating the residential area and institutional area would probably be good for work life balance. Trading a big chunk of hotel space for a smaller retail space would decrease outside foot traffic, especially with the institutional building acting as a separator from the main street. This retail space could potentially bring in valuable amenities like a coffee shop or a convenience store for the residential region above it.	4	3	4	3	Unsure if these are specific to the version of the assignment I was given, but these are some things that I think would be helpful for me to make better decisions; - Provide the user with a color-coded key for which floor area metrics correspond to which colors so they don't have to guess and check, but I did eventually figure it out; - I was given preset options so I didn't really get to test out the modeling part of FuzzyIO, but I do think that voxelization helps add a layer of abstraction to help users focus on the layouts/structures within real estate.; - Maybe it would be nice to give the user some potential outcomes/consequences/feedback of choosing certain options, even if it's after they've made the decision; - I wasn't very confident that the community would like my final scenario would like the option that I ended up choosing because I didn't have much input from them, just limitations regarding metrics that I assume are set by the city/planners.

zebraCXEMRJ	zebra	25 - 34	No	1	3	1	4	3	1	At least once per year	I chose Option 3	Because of the simplicity of the shape and the ease of imagining the design use of the environment.

panda57YUNC	panda	35 - 44	No	2	1	2	5	5	4	At least once per month	I chose my own completely original scenario	Coming from Nepal, I grew up with Architecture that had a "chowk" which is a surrounded middle space where statues, temples, or gardens could make it a safe place for kids to play or people to hang out with less worry about traffic. I chose a donut-like design that I came up with from scratch that seemed to have similar features.; ; I needed a tower, and I wanted to be as close to 5.0 on FAR as possible, and I wanted to have just enough for the Art Institute and residences. I then wanted to add retail and office for more income potential for the space.	5	4	5	5	I enjoyed the UI. It was nonintrusive and had the right level of abstraction for me. I am not a building architect or urban designer, though.
cobraZET4FC	cobra	35 - 44	Yes	2	3	4	5	5	5	At least once per week	I chose my own completely original scenario		3	3	4	4	Nice modeling tool! I like it.; ; Instead of a tutorial movie, a tutorial right on the screen of the tool might facilitate the learning procedure. 
zebra57US2Q	zebra	25 - 34	No	1	1	1	5	4	1	Rarely or Never	I chose Option 3	the dense residential area and small FAR	4	4	4	3

The progressive menus were good but on first go a bit difficult. Think a few added do-overs would be fun to play around and discover alternatives and how to manipulate the solutions to meet the goals.
cobraJA7WXY	cobra	25 - 34	Yes	4	4	3	1	2	4	At least once per year	I chose my own completely original scenario	First the site position and shape. I tried to put the housing away from the main road. Second, the floor area requirements. And third, I thought about the sunlight, flow of people, and juxtaposition of functions. 	2	2	4	2	I think the tool is easy to use. But in terms of usability in real urban decisions, I am not confident. That is because I find it hard to separate between real estate design and architectural design. however, my experience overall using the tool was positive. 
pandaXBG6GF	panda	25 - 34	No	1	1	1	5	1	1	Rarely or Never	I chose a modified version of Option 2	The design is very concise and impressive. It's more beautiful than other options for me.	3	2	4	5	I think that the requirments are too strict for a novice.
zebraXGBCAN	zebra	35 - 44	Yes	5	4	3	4	4	5	At least once per week	I chose Option 3	I like the shape of the buildings better. There is also good potential for a park and public space. Buildings volumes also fulfill area requirements and FAR.	3	3	3	2	I like the idea of visualization of the volume of the buildings through the voxels. The interface looks nice and easy to use. But, it was a bit unclear to me, which color represents which function in the table. A legend with information about color and function can help. Readability can be also improved thru 3D text which can be placed in the model similar to the figure from the intro where all parts of the model are described. And a really minor suggestion is to remove glossiness from the material of the map.
zebra2PJB29	zebra	25 - 34	No	1	1	1	5	2	1	Rarely or Never	I chose Option 2	I like the point that there are not only art college and residential area but also retail floors and hotel floors. I appreciate the value available as well as the appearance.; ; 大学エリアと居住エリアのほかにホテルや商業施設が含まれていることで、町の人々にとっても利用しやすい・楽しめる施設となっていたことから Option 2 を選択しました。	4	4	2	2	In this experiment (at least on Page 3), the participants are asked to choose their favorite model from three 3D models prepared in advance. But since "FuzzyIO is a modeling software" is explained in the first half of the document and in the video explanation, I expected that some modeling would be necessary in the experiment. It would have been less confusing if it was clearly stated somewhere in the explanation on Page 3 that "no modeling is needed on this page".; ; 今回の実験（のうち少なくともPage 3）では、事前に用意された3つの3Dモデルから気に入ったものを選ぶという内容だったが、「FuzzyIOはモデリングソフトである」という説明が前半資料や動画説明で入ることから、実験において何らかのモデリングが必要であると予想してしまった。Page 3の説明で「このページではモデリングは行わない」ということがどこかに明記されているとより混乱なく進められたように思える。
zebra9GF7QG	zebra	25 - 34	No	3	1	1	5	5	5	At least once per week	I chose Option 3	Option 1 and Option 3 meet the requirements.; Of these two options, I prefer Option 3 because the residential area and the institutional area are divided into two buildings.; ; I feel students cannot refresh from home to work if they only use elevators in the same building. Also, it'll be good if people can enter both functions from the ground level.; ; But I'm not sure if Option 3 is perfect, because most of the area is covered by the facade from the large street and the appearance can be like a fortress, which might not be good for blending the campus in the town.	4	3	4	4	It'll be good to have a function of a comparison table of related numbers.; It’d be easier to understand if FAR is defined by GFA/GLA, although I feel this is a technical term and cannot be changed.; From users, it’s not possible to grasp what color means what functions
zebraEKZJSH	zebra	25 - 34	Yes	2	3	2	2	1	4	At least once per month	I chose Option 3	The residences and institutions of 1 are connected together and may interfere with each other from functional considerations. 2 has a non-conforming floor area ratio. 3 has a clearer functional division and the residential area is located on the side farther away from the main road and may be quieter. The floors are higher, which can meet the expectation of high rise residential landscape.	4	4	3	4	Not used to the operation of the mouse wheel when zooming in and out of the view.
